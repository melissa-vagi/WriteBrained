# Welcome

Hi, I'm Melissa Vagi, a technical writer who has spent the past decade helping software engineers, developers, product managers, and other technical groups communicate effectively. I'm passionate about writing complex technical concepts simply and plainly so that readers have succinct, easy-to-digest information without all the jargon.
